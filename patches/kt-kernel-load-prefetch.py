"""Read a layer's expert weights into the page cache with parallel preads
before kt-kernel copies them (KT_LOAD_PREFETCH=<threads>, 0 = off).

kt-kernel's load_weights hands the C++ side zero-copy views on safetensors'
private mmap and copies each expert into the memfd arenas with memcpy. The
disk reads are the page faults those memcpys take, one readahead window at a
time (128 KiB on one of the host's NVMe drives, 1 MiB on the other), so the drive
runs at about 1 GB/s during a launch when it can do 5-6 GB/s. madvise /
fadvise WILLNEED did not help (10-07, 141 vs 142 s for Vision's 43 layers):
the kernel clamps each call to the same readahead window.

With KT_LOAD_PREFETCH=N, load_experts resolves every weight tensor's byte
range from the safetensors headers, merges neighbouring ranges, and N threads
pread them in 16 MiB pieces into a throwaway buffer before the C++ copy
starts. The copy then finds the pages in the cache. While a layer copies, the next
layer's read runs in the background; the previous layer's ranges are evicted
with fadvise(DONTNEED), so the cache holds at most two layers. With this on,
the sglang-side per-layer drop of the whole checkpoint must be skipped after
layer 0 (patches/sglang-kt-drop-cache-skip-prefetch.py) or it evicts the
background read. Off by default.
